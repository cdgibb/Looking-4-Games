## Description  
> Looking 4 Games (L4G) is an application designed to connect DND players, Dungeon Masters (DMs), and gaming venues to facilitate in-person gaming sessions. The platform enables players to find and join groups, while venues can promote available gameplay spaces.  
>  
> L4G serves as a hub where like-minded individuals can form gaming communities and interact in an environment enriched with associated media and merchandise. It fosters a judgment-free zone where businesses and players can connect, building communities beyond simple transactions.  
>  
> **Target Audience:**  
> - New DND players looking for a welcoming group.  
> - Experienced players seeking a new gaming community.  
> - Dungeon Masters wanting to find committed players for their campaigns.  
> - Business venues (e.g., card shops, bookstores, game cafÃ©s) that wish to host DND events and attract new customers.  
>  
> **Problem Statement:**  
> There is no centralized or efficient way for tabletop gamers to find local groups, campaigns, or venues that support in-person play. L4G bridges this gap by organizing players and locations in one place, simplifying the process of finding games, hosting events, and meeting new people.
